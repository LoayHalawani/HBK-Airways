# Description
The airline website features a main page where the user can search and book a flight either from the navbar that is implemented on all pages or from the buttons put in the first segment of the page or the one below. The website features a SignIn and a SignUp page where the user can create and account by inputting his/her details. The admin can access a specific page (addFlight.php) in order to insert the flight itineraries of available flights and add them to the database for the users to access them. The contact us page serves as a gateway between the user and the admin of the airline website to send recommendations or concerns to the airline itself from the user. Additionally, after the user inputs his/her search information in the search flight page, it would redirect him/her to either the roundtrip page or the one-way trip according to the option the user picked and would display him the details of flights that correspond with his/her search information. After the user chooses a flight from either a roundtrip results page or a one-way results page, he/she is redirected to the preferences page to choose flight accommodations. Thereafter, he/she is redirected to the payment page that displays the userâ€™s selected flight (with the ability to edit) and selected accommodations for the flight and the fields the user must fill in for payment in whichever currency the user picks.
